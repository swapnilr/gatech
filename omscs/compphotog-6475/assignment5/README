Assignment 5 Testing README:

If you wish to run the test to make sure that your code outputs the correct
type (reminder: THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR FUNCTION IS 'CORRECT', just
that it outputs the right type of data), input this into a terminal that is
in the directory of assignment2_test.py:
	python ./assignment5_test.py

GENERAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT INCLUDE code that saves, shows, displays, writes the image that
    you are being passed in. Do that on your own if you need to save the images
    but the functions should NOT save the image to file. (This is a problem
    for us when grading because running 200 files results a lot of images being
    saved to file and opened in dialogs, which is not ideal). Therefore, when
    you are submitting your file, make sure:
        a. It compiles.
        b. You do not use cv2.imwrite, cv2.imshow, or any other image writing
           function.

    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from the three libraries that we
    provide. You may not import anything else, you should be able to complete
    the assignment with the given libraries (and in most cases without them).

    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. Do not put functions into classes,
    or your own infrastructure. This makes grading very difficult for us. Please
    only write code in the allotted space.

If you wish to save an image, look at the documentation for cv2.imwrite.
If you wish to read in an image, look at the documentation for cv2.imread,
it is also used in assignment2_test.py.

Please feel free to ask any other questions about the assignment on Piazza!
Remember, ask sooner rather than later :).
