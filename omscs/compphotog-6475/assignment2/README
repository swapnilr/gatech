Assignment 2 Testing README:

If you wish to run the test to make sure that your code outputs the correct
type (reminder: THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR FUNCTION IS 'CORRECT', just
that it outputs the right type of data), input this into a terminal that is
in the directory of assignment2_test.py:
	python -m unittest discover -p '*_test.py'

UPDATE: Now that the file has been updated, you may run the following:
	python ./assignment2_test.py

If you wish to save an image, look at the documentation for cv2.imwrite.
If you wish to read in an image, look at the documentation for cv2.imread,
it is also used in assignment2_test.py.

Please feel free to ask any other questions about the assignment on Piazza!
Remember, ask sooner rather than later :).
