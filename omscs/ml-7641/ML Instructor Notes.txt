This paper(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/PCA-Tutorial-Intuition_jp.pdf) does a fantastic job building the intuition and implementation behind PCA

An eigenproblem is a computational problem that can be solved by finding the eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors of a matrix. In PCA, we are analyzing the covariance matrix (see the paper for details)

Cocktail Party Demo(http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/cocktail/cocktail_en.cgi)

This paper(http://mlsp.cs.cmu.edu/courses/fall2012/lectures/ICA_Hyvarinen.pdf) gives a fairly in-depth look at how the ICA algorithm works. It's long, but comprehensive

ICA has also been applied to the information retrieval problem, in a paper(http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/papers/isbell-ica-nips-1999.pdf) written by Charles himself

This excellent paper(http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sapphire/pubs/148494.pdf) is a great resource for the Feature Transformation methods from this course, and beyond

RL 1
AI: A Modern Approach.(http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

A proof of the convergence of Value Iteration can be found on Slide 25 of these excellent slides(http://www.robotvisions.org/4641/downloads/MDPIntro.pdf)

RL 2 
A full proof of the convergence of Q-learning, written by the creator of Q-learning, can be found here(http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/cjch.pdf)

This paper(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume4/kaelbling96a.pdf) offers a summary and an investigation of the field of reinforcement learning. It's long, but chock-full of information!

RL 3 Game Theory

Andrew Moore's slides on Zero-Sum Games(http://www.autonlab.org/tutorials/gametheory.html)

Andrew Moore's slides on Non-Zero-Sum Games(http://www.autonlab.org/tutorials/nonzerosum.html)

RL 4
ML: it turns out that people tend to be Pavlov-like! A major difference is that people tend to defect when both players defect, indicating they just defect more overall. Check out this paper(http://www.pnas.org/content/93/7/2686.short) for some details
